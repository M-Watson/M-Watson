     <h4><b>What type of CTO does D.C. Need?</b></h4>
     <p>D.C.'s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Archana Vemulapalli, recently announced that she will step down in January 2018. In her 21 months of service to this city, Vemulapalli has led the development of a new data policy; hired D.C.'s first Chief Data Officer (CDO); and brought the city into the forefront of east coast technology culture through the Startup in Residence program, among other accomplishments.
